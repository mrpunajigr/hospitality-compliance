# Analyze Error Logs - Next Steps

## Great! I can see the logs are working!

From the screenshot, I can see extensive logging is happening, which means:
✅ Edge Function is running
✅ Logs are being captured
✅ System is processing requests

## What I Need from You:

### Option 1: Scroll Up in the Logs
In your terminal, **scroll up** to see if there are any **red error messages** or lines that mention:
- "AWS"
- "Textract" 
- "AccessDenied"
- "Error"
- "Failed"

### Option 2: Fresh Upload + Fresh Logs
1. **Upload a new image** at jigr.app/console/upload
2. **Immediately run**: `npx supabase functions logs process-delivery-docket --follow=false`
3. **Look for the most recent entries** (they'll have today's timestamp)

### Option 3: Filter for Errors Only
Try this command to see only error messages:
```bash
npx supabase functions logs process-delivery-docket --follow=false | grep -i error
```

## What We're Looking For:

The logs should show us exactly why the upload says "Function failed to start" even though the function appears to be running.

**Most likely culprits:**
- AWS Textract permission error
- AWS region configuration issue
- AWS API call failure

**Can you try Option 1 first - scroll up in the current logs to look for red error messages?**
