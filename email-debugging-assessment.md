# Email Delivery Issue - Technical Assessment for Big Claude

## 🔍 **Problem Statement**
Welcome emails are not being sent during user signup despite having:
- ✅ Working Resend API key (verified)
- ✅ Verified domain in Resend dashboard
- ✅ Proper DNS records (DKIM, SPF, DMARC)
- ✅ Account creation working perfectly

## 📊 **Current Status**

### **What's Working:**
- User signup completes successfully
- Supabase Auth user creation ✅
- Company creation and profile linking ✅
- Resend API key configuration ✅
- Domain verification in Resend ✅

### **What's NOT Working:**
- Welcome emails not being sent
- No visible errors in browser console during signup
- Email API calls may not be executing

## 🧪 **Test Results**

### **Resend Configuration Test:**
```bash
GET https://jigr.app/api/test-resend
```
**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Resend API key is configured! (send-only key - good for security)",
  "hasApiKey": true,
  "keyPreview": "re_XESGXdv...",
  "emailConfig": {
    "fromAddress": "dev@jigr.app", 
    "fromName": "JiGR Modular Solutions"
  }
}
```

### **Domain Status in Resend:**
- Domain appears to be verified
- DNS records properly configured
- DKIM, SPF, DMARC all verified ✅

## 🔧 **Current Implementation**

### **Signup Flow:**
1. User fills signup form
2. Supabase Auth creates user with auto-generated password
3. Company creation API called successfully
4. **Welcome email should be sent here** ← FAILING
5. User redirected to onboarding flow

### **Email Service Chain:**
```
create-account/page.tsx
  └─ sendWelcomeEmail() 
     └─ /api/send-email
        └─ Resend API
```

### **Key Files:**
- `/app/create-account/page.tsx` - Contains signup logic and `sendWelcomeEmail()` call
- `/lib/email/welcome-email.ts` - Welcome email service function
- `/app/api/send-email/route.ts` - API endpoint that calls Resend
- `/app/api/test-resend/route.ts` - Test endpoint (working)

## 🚨 **Recent Changes Made**
1. **Fixed sender domain** - Removed hardcoded "Acme" sender
2. **Added extensive logging** for email debugging
3. **Simplified email template** to eliminate complexity
4. **Enhanced error handling** in email service

## 🔍 **Debugging Evidence Needed**

### **Browser Console During Signup:**
Look for these specific log messages:
- `📧 Sending welcome email via Resend...`
- `📧 Email data:` (shows email parameters)
- `📧 Making API call to /api/send-email...`
- `📧 API response status:` (shows if API call succeeds)
- `✅ Welcome email sent successfully:` OR `❌ Welcome email failed:`

### **Network Tab During Signup:**
- Check for POST request to `/api/send-email`
- Status code of the request (200, 403, 500, etc.)
- Response body if request fails

### **Server Logs (if accessible):**
- Netlify function logs for `/api/send-email`
- Any error messages from Resend API

## 🤔 **Potential Root Causes**

### **Theory 1: Email Function Not Called**
- `sendWelcomeEmail()` might not be executing during signup
- Could be caught in try/catch and failing silently
- Check: Browser console should show email-related logs

### **Theory 2: API Route Issues**
- `/api/send-email` endpoint might be failing
- Environment variables might not be available in production
- Check: Network tab should show API call

### **Theory 3: Resend API Issues**
- Domain verification might have issues despite appearing verified
- API key permissions might be insufficient
- Rate limiting or other Resend restrictions
- Check: Test with `curl` POST to `/api/test-resend`

### **Theory 4: Environment Variable Issues**
- `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` might not be set in Netlify
- `RESEND_API_KEY` might be cached/not updated
- Check: Current config shows `dev@jigr.app` - is this domain actually verified?

## 🧪 **Diagnostic Tests to Run**

### **Test 1: Direct Email Test**
```bash
curl -X POST https://jigr.app/api/test-resend \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com"}'
```
**Expected:** Should send actual test email or show specific error

### **Test 2: Manual API Call**
```bash
curl -X POST https://jigr.app/api/send-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "to": "test@example.com",
    "subject": "Test Email",
    "template": "welcome",
    "data": {
      "companyName": "Test Company",
      "userFullName": "Test User", 
      "tempCode": "ABC123",
      "loginUrl": "https://jigr.app/signin"
    }
  }'
```
**Expected:** Should send welcome email or show specific error

### **Test 3: Signup Flow Debug**
1. Open browser console
2. Perform fresh signup
3. Check for email-related console logs
4. Check Network tab for `/api/send-email` calls

## 🎯 **Immediate Action Items**

1. **Verify email function execution** during signup
2. **Test direct email sending** via curl commands above
3. **Check Netlify environment variables** are properly set
4. **Verify actual domain** being used matches Resend verification
5. **Test with different email addresses** (Gmail, etc.)

## 💡 **Quick Win Suggestions**

1. **Try using Resend's test domain** first:
   ```
   EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=onboarding@resend.dev
   ```

2. **Simplify email content** to absolute minimum for testing

3. **Add more aggressive logging** to see exactly where the chain breaks

4. **Test email sending** independent of signup flow

## 🤝 **Request for Big Claude**

Please review this assessment and help identify:
1. **Most likely root cause** based on the evidence
2. **Best debugging approach** to quickly identify the issue  
3. **Alternative solutions** if current approach has fundamental flaws
4. **Quick fixes** that might resolve this immediately

The user has a working Resend account with verified domain, but welcome emails are simply not being delivered during the signup process.
