# OCR Data Quality Investigation Summary

## Investigation Request
The user reported that document upload worked and partial OCR occurred, but the extracted data is not correct. Specifically, "Fresh Dairy Co." was extracted as the supplier, but we need to understand what other data points were captured and identify accuracy issues.

## Database Schema Analysis

Based on the `database.ts` types and enhanced extraction migration, the `delivery_records` table should contain:

### Core OCR Fields
- `raw_extracted_text` - Raw text from Google Document AI
- `supplier_name` - Extracted supplier name
- `docket_number` - Invoice/docket reference number
- `delivery_date` - Date of delivery (ISO format)
- `confidence_score` - Overall extraction confidence (0-1)

### Legacy Product Data Fields  
- `products` - JSONB array of product descriptions (legacy field)
- `extracted_temperatures` - JSONB temperature data (legacy field)

### Enhanced AI Fields (New)
- `extracted_line_items` - JSONB detailed line items with quantities, prices
- `product_classification` - JSONB product categories and temperature requirements
- `confidence_scores` - JSONB granular confidence scores for each field
- `compliance_analysis` - JSONB temperature compliance analysis
- `estimated_value` - Calculated total delivery value
- `item_count` - Number of line items found
- `processing_metadata` - JSONB processing pipeline metadata

### Temperature Analysis Tables
- `temperature_readings` - Separate table for individual temperature readings
- `compliance_alerts` - Generated alerts for violations

## Expected Data Structure

From the Enhanced Document Processor, each processed document should contain:

```typescript
{
  supplier: {
    value: "Fresh Dairy Co.",
    confidence: 0.85,
    extractionMethod: "text_detection"
  },
  deliveryDate: {
    value: "2025-08-23T00:00:00Z",
    confidence: 0.90,
    format: "DD/MM/YYYY"
  },
  temperatureData: {
    readings: [
      {
        value: 4.2,
        unit: "C",
        context: "Dairy products",
        confidence: 0.88
      }
    ],
    overallCompliance: "compliant",
    analysis: {
      violations: [],
      riskAssessment: "low"
    }
  },
  lineItems: [
    {
      description: "Whole Milk 2L",
      quantity: 24,
      price: 3.50,
      confidence: 0.75
    }
  ],
  analysis: {
    productClassification: {
      categories: ["dairy"],
      temperatureRequirements: { min: 0, max: 5 },
      riskLevel: "medium"
    },
    estimatedValue: 84.00,
    itemCount: 1,
    overallConfidence: 0.82
  }
}
```

## Investigation Tools Created

### 1. Enhanced Debug API
Updated `/app/api/debug-delivery-records/route.ts` to query ALL OCR fields including:
- All legacy and enhanced extraction fields
- Specific search for "Fresh Dairy Co." records
- Temperature readings from separate table
- Processing errors and status

### 2. SQL Investigation Query
Created `INVESTIGATE_OCR_DATA.sql` with comprehensive queries to:
- Show recent delivery records with full OCR data
- Analyze extraction completeness
- Search for Fresh Dairy Co. across all fields
- Check JSON structure of stored data

## Key Investigation Questions

1. **Data Storage Format**: Are the enhanced fields (`extracted_line_items`, `product_classification`, etc.) being populated or are only legacy fields (`products`, `extracted_temperatures`) being used?

2. **Processing Pipeline**: Is the Enhanced Document Processor working correctly, or is it falling back to simpler extraction methods?

3. **Field Mapping**: Are the extraction results being properly mapped to the correct database fields during the update process?

4. **Confidence Scoring**: What confidence levels are being recorded, and are they indicating low-quality extractions?

5. **Processing Status**: Are documents completing processing successfully or failing partway through?

## Next Steps for Diagnosis

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Start Development Server**: Run `npm run dev` to access debug APIs
2. **Call Debug API**: Visit `/api/debug-delivery-records` to get comprehensive data dump
3. **Examine Fresh Dairy Record**: Look specifically at what data was stored for the Fresh Dairy Co. upload
4. **Check Processing Logs**: Review server logs for any processing errors or fallback usage

### Data Analysis Focus
1. **Raw Text Quality**: Check if `raw_extracted_text` contains readable text
2. **Extraction Accuracy**: Compare what's in raw text vs. what was extracted into structured fields
3. **Field Population**: Determine which extraction fields are actually populated
4. **Processing Metadata**: Check if processing completed all stages or used fallbacks

### Potential Issues to Investigate
1. **Google Cloud AI Configuration**: Missing or incorrect API credentials
2. **Database Migration Status**: Enhanced fields may not exist if migration wasn't applied
3. **Service Role Access**: Edge function may lack permissions to update all fields
4. **Fallback Mode**: System may be running in fallback mode with reduced accuracy
5. **Document Quality**: Original image may be low quality affecting OCR accuracy

## Resolution Path

Once we have the actual data from the debug API, we can:
1. Identify which extraction fields are populated vs. empty
2. Compare raw extracted text with structured data to find parsing errors
3. Check processing metadata to understand which AI stages completed successfully
4. Determine if the issue is in OCR accuracy, data parsing, or database storage
5. Implement targeted fixes based on the specific failure point identified

## Files to Review After Data Collection
- Check server logs in development console for processing errors
- Examine the actual uploaded image to assess quality
- Review Google Cloud AI processor configuration and credentials
- Verify database schema matches expected enhanced structure
