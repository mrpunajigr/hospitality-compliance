# üîç Check Edge Function Deployment Status

## Quick Verification Commands

### 1. Check if Edge Function Updated
```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard:
# 1. Go to Edge Functions
# 2. Click on "process-delivery-docket" 
# 3. Check the code - should contain AWS Textract imports, NOT "CLI Test"
# 4. Look for deployment timestamp - should be recent
```

### 2. Check Function Logs
```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard:
# 1. Go to Edge Functions ‚Üí process-delivery-docket
# 2. Click "Logs" tab
# 3. Look for recent invocation logs from upload attempts
# 4. Check for AWS errors vs "CLI Test" outputs
```

### 3. Force Redeploy
```bash
# If function still shows old code:
# 1. Copy ALL code from DEPLOY-REAL-AWS-TEXTRACT.md
# 2. Paste into Supabase Edge Function editor
# 3. Click "Deploy" button
# 4. Wait for "Deployed successfully" message
```

## Current Status Check

The console shows "Unknown Supplier" appearing again, which suggests:

**Possibility A**: Edge function is still in test mode and creating dummy records
**Possibility B**: Previous failed uploads are still in database  
**Possibility C**: AWS Textract code deployed but has authentication/configuration issues

## Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check Supabase Edge Function code** - Verify it contains AWS imports
2. **Check function logs** - Look for AWS API calls vs "CLI Test" outputs
3. **Verify AWS credentials** - Check if AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY are set
4. **Test function directly** - Use Supabase function test interface

The fact that processing is still failing suggests the real AWS code either:
- Didn't deploy properly
- Is missing AWS credentials  
- Has authentication errors
