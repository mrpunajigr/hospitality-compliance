# Next Session Plan - RBAC System Testing & Validation
## JiGR Hospitality Compliance Platform

---

## 🎯 **SESSION OBJECTIVES**

### **PRIMARY GOAL: Complete Admin Access & System Validation**
The production RBAC system is deployed but needs final user access configuration and comprehensive testing.

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL FIRST TASK (5 minutes)**

### **Fix Admin Access for dev@jigr.app**
**Issue**: User exists but has no RBAC role assigned
**Solution**: Run this SQL in Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Add dev@jigr.app as OWNER
INSERT INTO client_users (
  client_id, 
  user_id, 
  role, 
  status, 
  created_at,
  joined_at
)
VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM clients WHERE name = 'Demo Restaurant' LIMIT 1),
  '2815053e-c7bc-407f-9bf8-fbab2e744f25',
  'OWNER',
  'active',
  now(),
  now()
) ON CONFLICT (client_id, user_id) 
DO UPDATE SET role = 'OWNER', status = 'active', joined_at = now();

-- Verify it worked
SELECT 
  p.email,
  p.full_name,
  c.name as client_name,
  cu.role,
  cu.status
FROM profiles p
JOIN client_users cu ON p.id = cu.user_id
JOIN clients c ON cu.client_id = c.id
WHERE p.email = 'dev@jigr.app';
```

**Expected Result**: dev@jigr.app should have OWNER role and full admin access

## 📋 **SESSION TASK LIST**

### **Phase 1: Admin Access Validation (15 minutes)**
1. **✅ Fix user role assignment** (SQL above)
2. **Test admin console access** - should work without "Access Denied"
3. **Verify OWNER permissions** - all admin functions accessible
4. **Test role-based navigation** - all modules visible for OWNER

### **Phase 2: RBAC System Testing (30 minutes)**
5. **Create test users for each role:**
   - Create STAFF user via invitation system
   - Create SUPERVISOR user via invitation system  
   - Create MANAGER user via invitation system
   
6. **Test invitation workflow:**
   - Send invitation email (Demo mode shows in console)
   - Test invitation acceptance page
   - Verify role assignment after acceptance
   
7. **Validate permission boundaries:**
   - Login as STAFF → should see limited modules
   - Login as SUPERVISOR → should see reports/analytics
   - Login as MANAGER → should see team management
   - Login as OWNER → should see everything including billing

### **Phase 3: Email System Configuration (20 minutes)**
8. **Configure production email provider:**
   - Set up SendGrid API key in Netlify environment variables
   - Test actual email sending (not just console output)
   - Verify professional email templates render correctly
   
9. **Test end-to-end invitation flow:**
   - Send real invitation email
   - Accept invitation from email link
   - Verify user joins organization with correct role

### **Phase 4: iPad Air Testing (15 minutes)**
10. **Test touch interface:**
    - Verify 44px+ touch targets work properly
    - Test responsive design on tablet viewport
    - Validate touch gestures (if implemented)
    - Check Safari compatibility

### **Phase 5: Security Validation (10 minutes)**
11. **Test security systems:**
    - Verify rate limiting works (try multiple rapid requests)
    - Test CSRF protection (should block unauthorized requests)
    - Validate security headers are present
    - Test password complexity requirements
