# Next Session Plan - Profile Context Loading Issue
**Current Version:** v1.10.1.013  
**Last Completed:** Authentication system debugging and deployment

## üéØ Session Complete - What We Achieved

### ‚úÖ AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM WORKING
1. **Password Authentication Deployed** - Complete system is live and functional
2. **Password Fields Working** - Visible and functional on `/update-profile` page
3. **Email Verification Working** - Fresh accounts verify successfully with green checkmark
4. **Enhanced Error Logging** - Detailed API debugging deployed
5. **Root Cause Analysis** - Identified token reuse and profile context issues

### ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED
**Profile Context Problem:** After successful email verification, the update-profile page shows generic/wrong profile data instead of the specific user's information.

**Evidence:**
- ‚úÖ Email verification succeeds (green checkmark)
- ‚úÖ Password fields render correctly  
- ‚ùå Form doesn't load user-specific profile data
- ‚ùå Shows generic placeholders instead of actual user context

## üîÑ URGENT NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

### 1. **Fix Profile Data Loading** (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Update-profile page not loading correct user context after verification
**Root Cause:** User authentication context not properly established post-verification
**Required Fix:** Ensure authenticated user data loads correctly in form

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check if `currentUser` state is loading correct user after verification
2. Verify user ID matches between verification and profile loading  
3. Ensure form initializes with actual user email/data
4. Fix authentication context passing from verification to profile

### 2. **Test Complete Authentication Flow** (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Current Status:** Can verify email successfully but profile context fails
**Required Testing:**
1. Fresh account creation
2. Email verification (working)
3. Profile completion with correct user data (broken)
4. Password creation (ready to test once profile fixed)
5. Company setup and signin flow

### 3. **Profile Context Implementation** (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Issue:** Form shows generic data instead of user-specific information
**Solution Required:**
- Load actual user email from authentication
- Initialize form with verified user's data
- Ensure user ID consistency throughout flow

## üîß TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

### Authentication Flow Status
```
‚úÖ Registration ‚Üí ‚úÖ Email Send ‚Üí ‚úÖ Email Verification ‚Üí ‚ùå Profile Context Loading
```

### Working Components
- Password authentication system (deployed)
- Email verification process  
- Password field rendering
- Form submission API (ready for testing)
- Enhanced error logging

### Broken Components
- User context loading after verification
- Profile data initialization 
- Form state management with authenticated user

## üìã DEBUGGING INFORMATION READY

### Enhanced Error Logging Deployed
- Set-password API has detailed error reporting
- Network tab will show exact failure reasons
- User ID tracking implemented

### Files Created This Session
- `debug-profile-update-failure.md` - Comprehensive debugging guide
- `fix-set-password-debugging.md` - Enhanced logging implementation
- Enhanced set-password API with detailed error handling

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR NEXT SESSION

1. **Profile page loads correct user data** after email verification
2. **Form initializes with verified user's email** (not generic placeholders)  
3. **Password creation completes successfully** with correct user context
4. **Complete authentication flow works end-to-end**
5. **User can sign in with created password**

## üîç KEY FILES TO INVESTIGATE

### Primary Focus
- `app/update-profile/page.tsx` - Profile context loading logic
- User authentication state management after verification
- Form initialization with authenticated user data

### Secondary Focus  
- `app/api/set-password/route.ts` - Already enhanced with logging
- Email verification to profile transition
- Authentication context persistence

## üí° LIKELY ROOT CAUSE

**Hypothesis:** The email verification succeeds but doesn't properly establish the authenticated user context for the profile page. The form renders with default/generic data instead of loading the verified user's information.

**Solution Direction:** Fix the user context loading in update-profile page to use the authenticated user's actual data rather than placeholders.
