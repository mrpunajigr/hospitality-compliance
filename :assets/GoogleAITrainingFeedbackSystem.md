## Training Feedback System for Google Cloud AI

Create a simple feedback interface that:

1. **Displays AI Extracted Data** with review buttons:
   - ✅ "Correct" - Data extracted perfectly
   - ❌ "Wrong" - Data needs correction
   - ➕ "Missing" - AI missed important data

2. **Correction Interface:**
   - Click wrong data to edit inline
   - Add missing fields the AI didn't catch
   - Submit corrections back to training pipeline

3. **Training Data Collection:**
   - Store original image + AI extraction + human corrections
   - Format data for Google Cloud AI training
   - Build dataset for future uptraining

4. **Progress Tracking:**
   - Show accuracy improvement over time
   - Track which suppliers have best/worst AI accuracy
   - Display confidence scores for extractions

   // Add feedback buttons to your results display
const FeedbackSystem = {
  onCorrectExtraction: () => savePositiveFeedback(extractedData),
  onIncorrectExtraction: () => saveCorrection(originalData, correctedData),
  onMissingData: () => saveGap(expectedField, missingValue)
}
