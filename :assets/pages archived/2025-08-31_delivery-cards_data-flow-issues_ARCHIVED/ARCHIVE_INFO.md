# Archive: Delivery Cards Component - Data Flow Issues

## Archive Date: 2025-08-31
## Reason: data-flow-issues - Persistent state management problems preventing card display

## Components Archived:
- `DeliveryDocketCard.tsx` - Working card component (155 lines)
- `EnhancedUpload.tsx` - Upload component with broken card integration (785 lines)

## Issue Summary:
- ✅ Upload functionality working (200 OK responses)
- ✅ Edge Function processing successful 
- ✅ Big Claude response mapping fixes applied
- ❌ Cards not displaying despite successful data flow
- ❌ Complex state management causing persistent issues

## Technical Details:
- **Interface**: `EnhancedExtractionResult` with proper structure
- **State Issue**: `f.result` field not being set correctly despite response mapping
- **Debugging**: Multiple fixes attempted including Big Claude's exact specifications
- **Console**: Shows processing success but `statusCounts.completed` not triggering cards

## Restoration Requirements:
1. Copy `original-code/DeliveryDocketCard.tsx` back to `/app/components/delivery/`
2. Copy `original-code/EnhancedUpload.tsx` back to `/app/components/delivery/`
3. Fix state management issues before restoration

## Dependencies:
- Design system utilities: `getCardStyle()`, `getTextStyle()`
- React hooks: `useState`, `useCallback`, `useRef`, `useEffect`
- Supabase client and Edge Function integration

## Next Steps (Nuclear Option):
- Request Big Claude to build fresh card component
- Integrate with working upload/processing logic
- Eliminate complex state management issues
