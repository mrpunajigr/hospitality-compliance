## 🔍 Search and Discovery

### Finding Archived Components
```bash
# Search by component name
find ":assets/pages archived" -name "*component-name*"

# Search by reason
find ":assets/pages archived" -name "*vercel-deployment-fix*"

# Search by date
find ":assets/pages archived" -name "2025-08-*"

# Search archive content
grep -r "search-term" ":assets/pages archived/"
```

### Archive Categories

- **🔧 Development Tools:** Debug panels, test interfaces, dev utilities  
- **📊 Admin Features:** Admin-only pages, management interfaces
- **🧪 Experimental Features:** Prototype components, A/B test variants
- **📱 Platform-Specific:** Components for specific deployment targets

## 🔄 Restoration Process

### When to Restore
1. **Feature Request:** Users/stakeholders request archived functionality
2. **Architecture Evolution:** New patterns can incorporate old concepts
3. **Development Reference:** Need implementation patterns from archived code
4. **Bug Investigation:** Archived code contains solutions to current problems

### Restoration Steps
1. **Locate Archive:** Use search/index to find relevant archive
2. **Review Documentation:** Read `ARCHIVE_INFO.md` and `restoration-guide.md`
3. **Check Compatibility:** Verify current codebase compatibility
4. **Follow Restoration Guide:** Execute step-by-step restoration process
5. **Update Dependencies:** Adapt for current package versions
6. **Test Integration:** Verify functionality with existing systems
7. **Document Changes:** Note any modifications made during restoration
8. **Update Archive Status:** Mark as "Restored" in this README index

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Archive Maintenance
- **Never delete archives** without team consensus
- **Update index regularly** when adding new archives
- **Review annually** for restoration opportunities
- **Maintain search keywords** for easy discovery

### Quality Standards
- **Complete documentation required** - partial archives are not useful
- **Working restoration guides** - must be testable
- **Visual documentation essential** - screenshots preserve UX context
- **Dependency tracking critical** - enables successful restoration

### Integration with Development Workflow
- **Automatic reminder** in standard development workflow
- **Pre-commit hooks** can check for undocumented deletions
- **Code review requirement** for any component deletion
- **Archive-first policy** for all non-trivial removals
