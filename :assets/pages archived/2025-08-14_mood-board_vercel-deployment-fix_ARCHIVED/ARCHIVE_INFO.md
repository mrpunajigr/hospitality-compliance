# Mood Board Component - Archive Documentation

## Archive Details
- **Date Archived:** 2025-08-14 10:30 (Retroactive documentation)
- **Archived By:** Claude Development System
- **Reason:** Originally deleted during Vercel deployment fixes to resolve build errors
- **Git Commit:** b1f8e740 "Remove dev mood board to fix Vercel deployment - focus on production features"
- **Original Location:** `/app/mood-board/page.tsx` (and supporting components)
- **Restoration Status:** ✅ **SUCCESSFULLY RESTORED** (2025-08-14)

## Component Description
- **Purpose:** Interactive mood board for design system development and theme comparison
- **Key Features:** 
  - **Split Mode:** Side-by-side dark/light theme comparison
  - **Unified Mode:** Single view with live theme toggle
  - **Asset Management Integration:** Upload and select backgrounds dynamically
  - **Component Showcase:** Live examples of all design system components
  - **Theme Context:** Full ThemeProvider integration for real-time switching
- **Dependencies:** ThemeProvider, BackgroundSelector, AssetUploadModal, AssetManagerToggle
- **Integration Points:** Design system development, component testing, UX review

## Technical Details
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 with React 18+
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with design system utilities
- **State Management:** React Context (ThemeProvider) + useState hooks
- **External Dependencies:** Custom design system, asset management components
- **Environment:** Development-only (production-blocked with NODE_ENV checks)

## Deletion Context
- **Problem Solved:** Vercel deployment was failing due to ESLint quote escaping errors in mood board
- **Alternative Approach:** Style guide page provided basic component reference (but without interactive features)
- **Impact Assessment:** Lost interactive theme comparison, split/unified modes, and asset management integration
- **Future Considerations:** Essential for design system development and UX reviews
