## ‚úÖ Restoration Status: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
This guide documents the successful restoration process for future reference.

## üéØ Restoration Overview
The mood board component was successfully restored with enhanced functionality on 2025-08-14. This guide serves as a template for future component restorations.

## üìã Step-by-Step Restoration Process

### Step 1: Environment Verification ‚úÖ
**Verify current codebase compatibility:**
- [x] Next.js 15+ installed and configured
- [x] React 18+ available
- [x] Tailwind CSS configured
- [x] TypeScript support enabled
- [x] Design system utilities available (`@/lib/design-system`)
- [x] Theme context available (`@/lib/theme-context`)

### Step 2: Directory Structure ‚úÖ
**Create the component directory:**
```bash
mkdir -p /app/mood-board
```

### Step 3: Component Dependencies ‚úÖ
**Verify required components exist:**
- [x] `@/app/components/BackgroundSelector.tsx`
- [x] `@/app/components/AssetUploadModal.tsx` 
- [x] `@/app/components/AssetManagerToggle.tsx`
- [x] `@/lib/theme-context.tsx`
- [x] `@/lib/design-system.ts`

### Step 4: File Restoration ‚úÖ
**Copy the main component:**
```bash
cp "original-code/page.tsx" "/app/mood-board/page.tsx"
```

### Step 5: Code Integration ‚úÖ
**Key integration points verified:**

#### A. ThemeProvider Integration ‚úÖ
```typescript
import { ThemeProvider, useTheme } from '@/lib/theme-context'
```

#### B. Asset Management Integration ‚úÖ
```typescript
import BackgroundSelector from '@/app/components/BackgroundSelector'
import AssetUploadModal from '@/app/components/AssetUploadModal'
import AssetManagerToggle from '@/app/components/AssetManagerToggle'
```

#### C. Design System Integration ‚úÖ
```typescript
import { getCardStyle, getTextStyle, DesignTokens } from '@/lib/design-system'
```

### Step 6: Route Configuration ‚úÖ
**Next.js automatically configures route:**
- URL: `http://localhost:3000/mood-board`
- Development-only access (production blocked)

### Step 7: Production Security ‚úÖ
**Verify production blocking:**
```typescript
// Multiple layers of production blocking
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  throw new Error('Mood board not available in production')
}
```

### Step 8: Testing Verification ‚úÖ
**Complete functionality testing:**

#### A. Split Mode Testing ‚úÖ
- [x] Side-by-side theme comparison renders
- [x] Dark theme (left side) displays correctly
- [x] Light theme (right side) displays correctly  
- [x] Component showcase works in both themes
- [x] Mode switcher controls function

#### B. Unified Mode Testing ‚úÖ
- [x] Single view renders correctly
- [x] Theme toggle switches between light/dark
- [x] Component showcase adapts to theme changes
- [x] Mode switcher works

#### C. Asset Management Testing ‚úÖ
- [x] AssetManagerToggle dropdown opens
- [x] "Upload Background" opens AssetUploadModal
- [x] "Select Background" opens BackgroundSelector
- [x] Background changes apply in real-time
- [x] Modal closing works correctly

#### D. Responsive Testing ‚úÖ
- [x] Split mode works on desktop
- [x] Unified mode works on mobile
- [x] Controls remain accessible on all screen sizes
- [x] Component examples scale appropriately

### Step 9: Enhancement Implementation ‚úÖ
**Improvements made during restoration:**

#### A. Enhanced Asset Integration ‚úÖ
- Full asset management system integration
- Real-time background switching
- Upload and selection functionality

#### B. Improved Security ‚úÖ
- Multiple layers of production blocking
- Better error handling
- Environment validation

#### C. Better UX ‚úÖ
- Improved control layout
- Better responsive design
- Enhanced visual feedback

### Step 10: Documentation Update ‚úÖ
**Update project documentation:**
- [x] Archive documented in README.md
- [x] Restoration success recorded
- [x] Access URL documented
- [x] Future reference materials created

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Functionality Tests ‚úÖ
- [x] Component loads without errors
- [x] Split mode displays correctly
- [x] Unified mode displays correctly
- [x] Theme switching works
- [x] Asset management functions
- [x] Modal integrations work
- [x] Production blocking active

### Performance Tests ‚úÖ
- [x] No memory leaks detected
- [x] Smooth transitions
- [x] Fast theme switching
- [x] Efficient re-renders

### Compatibility Tests ‚úÖ
- [x] Works with current Next.js version
- [x] Compatible with existing components
- [x] No conflicts with design system
- [x] TypeScript compilation successful

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Import Path Errors
**Problem:** Module resolution fails for design system components
**Solution:** Verify all `@/` alias paths are correctly configured in tsconfig.json

### Issue 2: Theme Context Errors  
**Problem:** useTheme hook fails outside ThemeProvider
**Solution:** Ensure ThemeProvider wraps the entire component tree

### Issue 3: Production Access
**Problem:** Component accessible in production builds
**Solution:** Verify NODE_ENV checks are implemented correctly

### Issue 4: Asset Modal Issues
**Problem:** BackgroundSelector or AssetUploadModal not opening
**Solution:** Check component imports and prop passing
