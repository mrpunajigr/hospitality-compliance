# ðŸ”´ Debug Red Errors in Supabase Logs

## Error Analysis from Screenshot
I can see multiple red errors in the logs with 500 status codes indicating Edge Function runtime failures.

## Most Likely Issues

### 1. **Syntax Error in Edge Function**
When we deployed the updated code, there may be a syntax error or missing import causing the entire function to fail.

### 2. **Runtime Error During Processing**  
The function starts but crashes during execution, possibly due to:
- Missing environment variables
- Invalid AWS credentials format
- Database connection issues
- Type errors in the timeout implementation

### 3. **Validation Error Before Processing**
The function may be receiving parameters in an unexpected format.

## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check Edge Function Syntax
```bash
# The issue is likely in the recent changes to lines 113 and 1005
# Check for any missing commas, brackets, or quotes
```

### Step 2: Test Edge Function in Isolation
Let's create a minimal test to see if the function even boots:
1. Remove all processing logic temporarily
2. Just return a simple success response
3. Deploy and test

### Step 3: Check Environment Variables
Verify AWS credentials are still set correctly in Supabase Edge Function environment.

## Immediate Action Plan
1. **First**: Check for basic syntax errors in the deployed code
2. **Then**: Deploy a minimal test version to isolate the issue
3. **Finally**: Gradually add back functionality until we find the breaking point

## Common Deployment Issues
- Missing closing brackets
- Invalid JSON in environment variables  
- Type errors in the timeout Promise implementation
- Import path issues
