# Issue Identified: React Infinite Loop

## Problem:
- ✅ **API works perfectly** (returns success with data)
- ❌ **Dashboard shows infinite 500 errors** in Network tab
- ❌ **Component is making repeated failed API calls**

## Root Cause:
React useEffect dependency issue causing infinite API calls that eventually hit rate limits or timeouts.

## Solution:
Fix the useEffect dependency array in ComplianceDashboard component.

The API is fine - it's the frontend React code causing the infinite loop!
