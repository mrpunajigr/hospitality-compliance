# ðŸ”§ Fix Database Insert Issue - Deployment

## Issue Found
The Edge Function was still trying to insert `user_id: userId` in database records, but we know from previous debugging that **user_id MUST be null** to avoid foreign key constraint violations.

## Changes Made
âœ… **Fixed debug record insert** (line 113): `user_id: null`
âœ… **Fixed main record insert** (line 1005): `user_id: null`

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Updated Edge Function
```bash
# Go to Supabase Dashboard
# Navigate to: Edge Functions â†’ process-delivery-docket
# Copy the ENTIRE content from:
/Users/mrpuna/Claude_Projects/hospitality-compliance/supabase/functions/process-delivery-docket/index.ts

# Paste into dashboard and click Deploy
```

### 2. Test After Deployment
Upload a test image at:
- https://jigr.app/capture
- https://jigr.app/upload/bulk-training

### 3. Expected Results
âœ… **Image stored** in Supabase Storage bucket
âœ… **AWS Textract processing** completes successfully  
âœ… **Database record created** in delivery_records table
âœ… **No foreign key constraint errors**

## Root Cause
The same issue that plagued the API endpoints - **user_id foreign key constraints** - was still present in the Edge Function database inserts. The Edge Function was trying to insert a userId that doesn't exist in the profiles table, causing the insert to fail silently.

## Fix Applied
Changed all database inserts to use `user_id: null` instead of `user_id: userId`, which avoids the foreign key constraint and allows successful record creation.

**Deploy this fix and the database records will start appearing!** ðŸŽ¯
