# Fix AWS Textract Processing Hanging/Timeout Issue

## The Problem:
Your upload is hanging for too long during AWS Textract processing, which means the AWS API call is either:
1. **Taking too long** (AWS Textract timeout)
2. **Stuck in authentication loop** (credentials issue)
3. **Wrong AWS endpoint** (region/service issue)

## Immediate Fix Options:

### Option 1: Quick Timeout Fix (Recommended)
Let me reduce the AWS Textract timeout and add better error handling to prevent hanging.

**The Edge Function needs a shorter timeout and fallback.**

### Option 2: Test AWS Credentials Directly
Before fixing timeouts, let's test if your AWS credentials can actually call Textract:

**Test Command:**
```bash
# This tests if AWS credentials work (if you have AWS CLI installed)
aws textract detect-document-text --region us-east-1 --document '{"Bytes":"base64testdata"}' --dry-run
```

### Option 3: Fallback to Mock Processing (Temporary)
If AWS is taking too long, I can temporarily add a 10-second timeout that falls back to mock processing so your system works while we debug AWS.

## Most Likely Cause:
The AWS Textract API call is **hanging indefinitely** because:
- ❌ **AWS credentials don't have Textract permissions** (AWS returns no response)
- ❌ **Wrong region configured** (API call goes nowhere)
- ❌ **AWS service quota exceeded** (call queues forever)

## Quick Decision:
1. **Want me to add timeout + fallback?** (System works immediately, debug later)
2. **Want to test AWS credentials first?** (More investigation)
3. **Want to check AWS account limits?** (Check your AWS console)

**Which approach do you prefer? I can fix the hanging issue in 2 minutes with a timeout!**
