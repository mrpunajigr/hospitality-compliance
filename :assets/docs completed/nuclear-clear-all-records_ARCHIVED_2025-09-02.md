# NUCLEAR OPTION: Clear ALL Records

## Clear EVERYTHING from delivery_records table

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- NUCLEAR CLEAR: Delete ALL records from delivery_records
DELETE FROM delivery_records;

-- Verify table is completely empty
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records FROM delivery_records;

-- Show table structure to confirm it still exists
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'delivery_records';
```

## Expected Result
- `total_records: 0`
- Table structure intact but completely empty
- No possibility of stale data interference

## After Nuclear Clear
Upload a fresh delivery docket image - the database will be guaranteed empty so any record displayed MUST be the fresh upload.
