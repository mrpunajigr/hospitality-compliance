## Key Dependencies & Blockers

### Immediate Requirements:
- **Supabase Configuration**: Email auth setup in project settings
- **Email Service**: SMTP configuration for verification/password reset emails
- **Company Onboarding**: Decision on automatic vs manual company creation flow

### Potential Delays:
- **Email Deliverability Setup**: +2-4 hours for SMTP configuration
- **Complex Company Hierarchy**: +8-16 hours if advanced org structure needed
- **Data Migration Complexity**: +4-8 hours depending on existing data volume
