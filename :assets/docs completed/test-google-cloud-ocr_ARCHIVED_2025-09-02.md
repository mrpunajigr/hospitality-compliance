# Google Cloud OCR Verification Test

## Test the auth-test function with comprehensive logging

### Upload a delivery docket image via `/upload` and check the console for:

#### 1. Google Cloud Response Structure
```
🔍 FULL GOOGLE CLOUD RESPONSE:
[Complete JSON response from Google Cloud]
```

#### 2. Text Extraction Details
```
📄 ✅ TEXT EXTRACTION SUCCESS!
📄 TOTAL EXTRACTED TEXT LENGTH: [number]
📄 COMPLETE EXTRACTED TEXT:
==================================================
[All extracted text from the image]
==================================================
```

#### 3. Line-by-Line Analysis
```
📄 ALL EXTRACTED LINES:
  Line 1: "[first line of text]"
  Line 2: "[second line of text]"
  [etc...]
```

#### 4. Supplier Detection Logic
```
🔍 SUPPLIER NAME DETECTION:
  Checking line: "[each line being analyzed]"
✅ FOUND [SUPPLIER] MATCH in line: [matching line]
```

## What to Look For

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- `TEXT EXTRACTION SUCCESS!` message
- Non-zero text length
- Actual readable text in the extracted content
- Specific supplier names detected

### ❌ Failure Indicators:
- `TEXT EXTRACTION FAILED!` message
- Zero or very short text length
- Empty or garbled extracted content
- No supplier names detected

### 🔍 Processor Type Issues:
- If Google Cloud returns structured data but no `.text` field
- If response has pages/blocks but no consolidated text
- If processor is form-specific instead of general OCR

## Next Steps Based on Results

### If No Text Extracted:
1. Check processor type in Google Cloud Console
2. Verify processor is general OCR (not form-specific)
3. Test with high-contrast simple text image

### If Text Extracted But Wrong:
1. Check image quality and contrast
2. Verify delivery docket format is readable
3. Test with cleaner delivery docket images

### If Structure Issues:
1. Parse pages/blocks instead of document.text
2. Update extraction logic for specific processor type
