# ðŸš¨ NUCLEAR OPTION: Edge Function Deployment Crisis

## The Problem
Even minimal code is showing syntax errors. This indicates:
1. **Dashboard corruption** - The web editor may have encoding issues
2. **Hidden characters** - Copy/paste introducing invisible characters
3. **Browser issues** - JavaScript parsing problems in the dashboard

## Nuclear Solutions (Try in Order)

### Option 1: Try Different Browser
1. Open **Chrome Incognito** or **Firefox Private**
2. Go to Supabase Dashboard
3. Try deploying the minimal code again

### Option 2: CLI Deployment (Most Reliable)
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/mrpuna/Claude_Projects/hospitality-compliance

# Create a clean index.ts file
cat > supabase/functions/process-delivery-docket/index.ts << 'EOF'
import { serve } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts'

serve(async (req) => {
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ 
    success: true, 
    message: 'Clean deployment working!' 
  }), {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
  })
})
EOF

# Deploy via CLI
npx supabase functions deploy process-delivery-docket --project-ref jyxypcyrtdpqgapnkhec
```

### Option 3: Delete and Recreate Function
1. **Delete** the entire Edge Function in dashboard
2. **Create new** Edge Function with different name
3. **Deploy** minimal code to new function
4. **Update API calls** to use new function name

### Option 4: Restore from Git Backup
```bash
# Find the last working commit
git log --oneline | head -10

# Restore the Edge Function file from last working commit
git checkout [COMMIT_HASH] -- supabase/functions/process-delivery-docket/index.ts

# Deploy the restored version
```

## Most Likely Solution: CLI Deployment
The dashboard web editor seems to have parsing issues. CLI deployment bypasses this completely.

## Alternative: Use Different Function Name
Create `process-docket-v2` as a completely new function to avoid any corruption in the existing one.

## Emergency Measure
If all else fails, we can temporarily disable the Edge Function and have the API endpoints return mock data until we can resolve the deployment issue.

**Try the CLI deployment first - that's most likely to work!**
