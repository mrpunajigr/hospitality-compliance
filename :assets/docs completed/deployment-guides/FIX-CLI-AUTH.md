# üîë Fix Supabase CLI Authentication

## The Problem
CLI deployment failed with "Your account does not have the necessary privileges"

## Solution: Authenticate with Supabase CLI

### Step 1: Login to Supabase CLI
Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
npx supabase login
```

This will:
1. Open your web browser
2. Ask you to login to Supabase
3. Authenticate the CLI with your account

### Step 2: After Login, Try Deploy Again
```bash
npx supabase functions deploy process-delivery-docket --project-ref jyxypcyrtdpqgapnkhec
```

## Alternative: Use Personal Access Token
If login doesn't work, you can use a personal access token:

### Step 1: Get Access Token
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token"
3. Copy the token

### Step 2: Set Token
```bash
npx supabase login --token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

### Step 3: Deploy
```bash
npx supabase functions deploy process-delivery-docket --project-ref jyxypcyrtdpqgapnkhec
```

## Quick Fix Alternative: Just Use the Dashboard
Since we know the file was created successfully (you can see the code in the terminal), we can:

1. **Copy the generated file content**
2. **Go back to Supabase Dashboard** 
3. **Try pasting it one more time** in a different browser
4. **The file is now clean** (no encoding issues from our CLI creation)

## What Worked
‚úÖ The CLI **successfully created** the clean Edge Function file
‚úÖ No syntax errors in the file itself
‚ùå Just need **authentication** to deploy it

**Try the `npx supabase login` command first!**
