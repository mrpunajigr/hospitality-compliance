# ðŸ”’ Fix RLS Policy Blocking Database Insert

## The Problem
RLS (Row Level Security) policy is blocking delivery_records insert even with service role.

## Quick Solution: Bypass RLS for Service Role

Go to **Supabase Dashboard** â†’ **SQL Editor** and run:

```sql
-- Allow service role to bypass RLS on delivery_records table
ALTER TABLE delivery_records FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Grant all permissions to service role
GRANT ALL ON delivery_records TO service_role;

-- Create policy to allow service role inserts
CREATE POLICY "Allow service role full access" ON delivery_records
FOR ALL 
TO service_role
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);
```

## Alternative: Disable RLS Temporarily

If the above doesn't work, temporarily disable RLS:

```sql
-- Temporarily disable RLS on delivery_records
ALTER TABLE delivery_records DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

## Test After Fix
1. **Run the SQL** in Supabase Dashboard
2. **Upload Image #45** 
3. **Should see successful database insert**

## Why This Happens
Edge Functions use service_role credentials but RLS policies can still block inserts if not configured properly for the service role.

**Run the first SQL block and test again!**
