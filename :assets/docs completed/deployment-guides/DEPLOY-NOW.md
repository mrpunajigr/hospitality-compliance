# ðŸš€ DEPLOY NOW - You're Authenticated!

## You're Ready! Now Deploy the Edge Function

Copy and paste this command in your terminal:

```bash
npx supabase functions deploy process-delivery-docket --project-ref jyxypcyrtdpqgapnkhec
```

## What Should Happen
You should see:
- âœ… "Deploying Function process-delivery-docket..."
- âœ… "Function deployed successfully"
- âœ… No permission errors this time!

## After Successful Deployment
1. **Go test it**: https://jigr.app/capture or https://jigr.app/upload/bulk-training
2. **Should see green logs** instead of red errors
3. **Database records should be created** successfully

## If It Works
- âœ… Upload will complete successfully
- âœ… "CLI deployment working!" message in logs  
- âœ… Database record created with test data
- âœ… No more syntax errors or red errors!

## The Test Function Will
- Create a database record with:
  - client_id: 'cli-test'
  - processing_status: 'cli_success'  
  - raw_extracted_text: 'CLI Test - [timestamp]'
- Return success message: "CLI deployment working!"

**Run the deploy command now - you're authenticated and ready to go!** ðŸŽ¯
