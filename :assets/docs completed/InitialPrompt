Looking back through our conversation, I found the comprehensive project kickoff prompt. It was the "Initial Prompt for Cursor Claude - Planning Mode" document I created for you. Here it is:

## Initial Prompt for Cursor Claude - Planning Mode

**Project**: JiGR Hospitality Compliance Platform - Delivery Docket Processing Module

**Context**: I'm building a comprehensive SaaS platform for hospitality compliance, starting with a delivery docket processing module. This is the first module in a larger ecosystem of bolt-on compliance solutions.

**CRITICAL COMPATIBILITY REQUIREMENT**: All frontend code must be compatible with iPad Air (2013) running Safari 12. This means:
- ES5/ES6 JavaScript only (no modern syntax)
- Polyfills for newer features  
- Optimized for 1GB RAM constraints
- Simple, lightweight UI components
- Basic camera/file upload functionality

**Current Setup**: 
- Next.js 14 app with Supabase backend
- Google Cloud Document AI for document processing
- Stripe for billing and subscriptions
- Deployed on Vercel
- Target device: iPad Air (2013) with Safari 12

**Request**: Please read and analyze ALL the planning documents in this project folder (all .md files) and the template folder structure. Then provide a comprehensive development plan that covers:

1. **Database Schema Design** - Multi-tenant structure supporting client isolation
2. **Edge Functions Architecture** - Document processing and billing automation  
3. **Frontend Components** - iPad Air compatible UI components
4. **Authentication System** - Multi-tenant user management with role-based access
5. **Document Processing Pipeline** - Google Cloud AI integration
6. **Billing Integration** - Stripe subscription and usage tracking
7. **Compliance Features** - Reporting, audit trails, violation alerts

**Planning Documents to Review**:
- process-delivery-docket-edge-function.md
- multi-tenant-auth-user-management.md  
- stripe-webhook-edge-function.md
- customer-onboarding-flow.md
- phase-1-compliance-features.md
- app-architecture-structure.md
- All other .md files in the project

**Template Analysis**: Review the existing template folder structure and identify how to adapt it for this compliance platform while maintaining consistency.

**Success Criteria**:
- Professional, production-ready code
- iPad Air (2013) Safari 12 compatibility
- Multi-tenant security and data isolation
- Scalable architecture for future bolt-on modules
- Complete feature implementation matching planning documents

**Output Expected**:
1. Comprehensive technical architecture plan
2. Database schema with migrations
3. Edge Functions implementation
4. Frontend component structure
5. Integration points and API design
6. Testing strategy for iPad Air compatibility
7. Deployment and configuration steps

**Key Business Context**: This delivery docket module is designed for small hospitality businesses (cafes, restaurants, bars) who need affordable compliance solutions. The platform must be:
- Cost-effective for small businesses
- Simple enough for staff to use on older iPads
- Professional enough for health inspector reviews
- Scalable for future compliance modules

Please provide a structured development plan that transforms these planning documents into a working, production-ready compliance platform.

This was your comprehensive project kickoff prompt that included all the planning documents and the iPad Air compatibility requirements. You can use this as the foundation for your fresh Claude Code instance, along with the working layout.tsx I provided as a proven starting point.
