## üîÑ Archival Process

### **When Files Are Archived:**
1. **Phase Completion**: When development phases are completed and documentation is no longer needed for active work
2. **Feature Implementation**: When implementation summaries are complete and features are stable
3. **Template Supersession**: When templates are replaced by newer versions
4. **Issue Resolution**: When debugging guides resolve issues and serve as historical reference

### **Archive Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ No longer referenced in `CLAUDE.md` or active development workflow
- ‚úÖ Phase or feature completion documented
- ‚úÖ Superseded by newer documentation
- ‚úÖ Debug issues resolved and documented

### **Retention Policy:**
- **Permanent Retention**: All archived documentation is preserved permanently for audit and reference
- **Searchable History**: Archived files maintain searchable project history
- **Rollback Reference**: Available for reference if similar issues arise
- **Compliance Documentation**: Maintains complete project documentation trail

### **Restoration Process:**
If archived documentation becomes relevant again:
1. Copy (don't move) the archived file back to project root
2. Remove the archive date tag from filename
3. Update any references in active documentation
4. Leave original in archive for historical record
