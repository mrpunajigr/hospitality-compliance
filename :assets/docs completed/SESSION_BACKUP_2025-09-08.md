## Session Summary
**Phase 2B Module Restoration - Console Page UI Improvements**

### Work Completed:
1. ✅ Removed 4th statistics card (Today's Activity) while keeping 4-column layout with only first 3 filled

   - Delivery Date: 7 Sept 2025
   - Upload Date: 08/09/2025, 19:xx
   - Uploaded By User: Steve Puna (steve@jigr.co.nz)

3. ✅ Repositioned Results Card to span 3 columns wide directly under statistics cards
4. ✅ Removed "Latest Upload" heading for cleaner layout
5. ✅ Enhanced mock data with proper user information and realistic values
