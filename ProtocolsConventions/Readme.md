# üö® PROTECTED PROTOCOLS & CONVENTIONS

## ‚õî CRITICAL: DO NOT DELETE OR MODIFY

This folder contains essential development protocols and conventions for the JiGR platform ecosystem. These documents represent critical strategic planning and must be preserved at all costs.

## üõ°Ô∏è FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

### **NEVER DO THESE:**
- ‚ùå Delete this folder or any files within it
- ‚ùå Rename files in this folder
- ‚ùå Modify existing protocols without explicit human approval
- ‚ùå Move these files during cleanup operations
- ‚ùå Archive or compress these documents
- ‚ùå Change file extensions or formats
- ‚ùå Merge or split protocol documents

### **WARNING SIGNS:**
If you see any of these requests, **STOP IMMEDIATELY** and ask for human intervention:
- "Clean up the root directory"
- "Remove old documentation"
- "Reorganize project files"
- "Update naming conventions"
- "Consolidate documentation"

## ‚úÖ ALLOWED ACTIONS

### **YOU MAY:**
- ‚úÖ READ protocols before making changes to the codebase
- ‚úÖ REFERENCE conventions for new development
- ‚úÖ COPY protocols to other locations (never move originals)
- ‚úÖ CREATE new protocols with explicit human approval
- ‚úÖ ADD supplementary documentation alongside existing protocols

### **WHEN IN DOUBT:**
- **Ask first, act second**
- **Default to preservation over modification**
- **Seek explicit permission for any changes**

## üìã PROTOCOL USAGE REQUIREMENTS

### **MANDATORY READING:**
These protocols MUST be read and followed for ALL development work:

1. **Before making architectural changes** ‚Üí Read ClaudeCodeSafetyProtocol.md
2. **Before creating new files** ‚Üí Follow JiGRNamingConventionPolicy.md
3. **Before debugging visual issues** ‚Üí Use ScreenshotAnalysisProtocol.md
4. **Before version releases** ‚Üí Implement EnhancedVersionProtocol.md
5. **Before design changes** ‚Üí Reference VisualStyleGuidePrompt.md
6. **Before database changes** ‚Üí Consider DatabasePortabilityProtocol.md
7. **Before document processing changes** ‚Üí Review DocumentAIExtractionSystem.md

## üéØ PROTOCOL SUMMARIES

### **ClaudeCodeSafetyProtocol.md**
- **Purpose:** Prevent breaking changes and ensure safe development
- **Critical Rules:** Never rename existing files, always test changes, stop for architectural changes
- **When to Use:** Before ANY code modifications

### **JiGRNamingConventionPolicy.md**
- **Purpose:** Maintain consistent PascalCase naming across the ecosystem
- **Critical Rules:** New files use PascalCase, existing files renamed only during refactoring
- **When to Use:** When creating any new files or components

### **ScreenshotAnalysisProtocol.md**
- **Purpose:** Professional visual development tracking and debugging
- **Critical Rules:** Analyze and rename screenshots using standard format
- **When to Use:** When debugging visual issues or documenting progress

### **EnhancedVersionProtocol.md**
- **Purpose:** Precise version tracking with build numbers
- **Critical Rules:** Auto-increment builds, display versions in development
- **When to Use:** For all version management and bug reporting

### **VisualStyleGuidePrompt.md**
- **Purpose:** Create development-only component reference page
- **Critical Rules:** Development environment only, never deploy to production
- **When to Use:** When creating the style guide or making design decisions

### **DatabasePortabilityProtocol.md**
- **Purpose:** Ensure vendor independence and migration capability
- **Critical Rules:** Document all schemas in vendor-neutral format
- **When to Use:** When making database schema changes

### **DocumentAIExtractionSystem.md**
- **Purpose:** Intelligent document processing with configurable results
- **Critical Rules:** Maintain mandatory fields, allow optional field configuration
- **When to Use:** When working with document processing features

## üö® EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### **IF PROTOCOLS ARE ACCIDENTALLY MODIFIED:**
1. **STOP all development immediately**
2. **Restore from git history:** `git checkout HEAD~1 ProtocolsConventions/`
3. **Verify all protocols are intact**
4. **Document what was lost**
5. **Implement additional safeguards**

### **IF PROTOCOLS ARE DELETED:**
1. **DO NOT CONTINUE development**
2. **Restore from backup immediately**
3. **Contact human developer urgently**
4. **Audit what other damage occurred**
5. **Implement protection mechanisms**

### **IF UNSURE ABOUT PROTOCOL INTERPRETATION:**
1. **Default to the safest approach**
2. **Ask for human clarification**
3. **Document the ambiguity**
4. **Wait for explicit guidance**

## üìû ESCALATION PROTOCOL

### **WHEN TO ESCALATE:**
- Any request to modify protocols
- Unclear instructions about protocol application
- Conflicts between protocols and other requirements
- Discovery of protocol violations
- Uncertainty about safe development practices

### **HOW TO ESCALATE:**
```bash
echo -e "\aüö® PROTOCOL VIOLATION OR UNCERTAINTY DETECTED üö®\a"
```

Then clearly explain:
- Which protocol is involved
- What action was requested
- Why it requires human intervention
- Recommended safe alternative

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### **PROTOCOLS ARE WORKING WHEN:**
- No existing functionality breaks during development
- Consistent naming conventions across all new files
- Professional visual documentation and debugging
- Precise version tracking and communication
- Database remains vendor-independent
- Document processing maintains configurable flexibility

### **PROTOCOLS NEED ATTENTION WHEN:**
- Breaking changes occur unexpectedly
- Naming becomes inconsistent
- Debug communication becomes unclear
- Version tracking breaks down
- Database becomes vendor-locked
- Document processing loses flexibility

## üõ†Ô∏è MAINTENANCE NOTES

### **PROTOCOL EVOLUTION:**
- Protocols may be updated based on project evolution
- Changes require explicit human approval and documentation
- Old versions should be preserved for reference
- Updates must maintain backward compatibility

### **REGULAR REVIEWS:**
- Protocols should be reviewed quarterly for relevance
- Implementation effectiveness should be assessed
- Team feedback should be incorporated
- Best practices should be updated

**These protocols protect the JiGR platform's development standards and ensure consistent, professional, scalable code architecture. They are the foundation of our development excellence.**

**REMEMBER: When in doubt, preserve and protect. Better to ask permission than to break working systems.**
