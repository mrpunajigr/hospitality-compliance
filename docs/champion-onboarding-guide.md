## Step-by-Step Champion Onboarding

### Phase 1: Initial Registration & Setup

#### Step 1: Champion Discovers JiGR
- Champion (Head Chef) finds JiGR through marketing/referral
- Visits landing page and clicks "Start Free Trial"
- **Key Point**: Champion doesn't own the business but has operational authority

#### Step 2: Account Creation
1. Champion fills out registration form:
   - Name: "Chef Maria Rodriguez"
   - Email: "maria@restaurantname.com"
   - Position: "Head Chef" (this is critical)
   - Company: "Bella Vista Restaurant"
   - Phone: Optional

2. **System Logic**: 
   - System detects this is NOT the business owner
   - Automatically assigns **CHAMPION role** (not OWNER)
   - Creates evaluation mode client with 30-day trial

#### Step 3: Champion Welcome Flow
1. Champion receives welcome email explaining:
   - Their role as evaluation champion
   - 30-day evaluation period
   - Goal: Configure system to show value to owner
   - Incentives for successful handoff

2. **First Login Experience**:
   - Dashboard shows "Champion Evaluation Mode" banner
   - Success score starts at 0%
