## Technical Context from Previous Session

### Files Referenced During Session
- `/app/forgot-password/page.tsx` - Checked for consistency after recent updates
- `/app/login/page.tsx.backup` - Reviewed backup login page implementation

## Key Documentation Updates

### CLAUDE.md Additions
Added critical Git Deployment Protocol section:

## Git Deployment Protocol

**CRITICAL**: Auto-trigger deployment when committing to GitHub

When making commits, Claude must:
1. Complete all code changes and testing
2. Commit changes to the main branch
3. Deployment will automatically trigger via GitHub Actions
4. Monitor deployment status and address any issues
```

## Next Session Preparation

### Immediate Task Ready for Implementation
- **Privacy Statement Page Creation**: User indicated content is already written, just needs implementation
- Should follow existing page patterns and routing structure
- Likely needs integration with navigation system

### System Status
- All recent landing page and routing changes are live and functional
- No pending technical debt from previous session
- Clean state for continuing development work

### Files That May Need Attention
- Navigation components (to add Privacy Statement link)
- Footer components (common location for privacy links)
- Route structure documentation

## Session Efficiency Notes
- Short, focused session with clear documentation updates
- Minimal context usage due to simple tasks
- Good preparation for next development session
- Clear handoff with specific next task identified
