# 🚀 Development Workflow: Big Claude → Implementation Pattern

## Overview

This document establishes our standard workflow for developing complex components and features in the JiGR Hospitality Compliance platform. The two-phase approach leverages Big Claude's comprehensive planning capabilities with Claude Code's execution speed and real-time adaptability.

## 📋 Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Strategic Planning (Big Claude)
**Purpose**: Create comprehensive implementation plans for complex features

**When to Use Big Claude Planning:**
- Multi-step user workflows
- Database schema changes with UI components
- Integration between multiple systems
- Advanced UI components with complex state management
- API design with multiple endpoints
- Features requiring 3+ separate files or components
- Architectural decisions that affect multiple parts of the system

**Big Claude Deliverables:**
- Complete technical specification
- File structure and component breakdown
- Database schema changes (if needed)
- API endpoint specifications
- Integration points with existing systems
- Testing strategy and acceptance criteria
- Implementation timeline and dependencies

### Phase 2: Systematic Implementation (Claude Code)
**Purpose**: Execute the plan with real-time problem solving and user feedback

**Implementation Process:**
1. **TodoWrite Planning**: Break down Big Claude's plan into trackable todo items
2. **Systematic Development**: Implement components following the specification
3. **Real-time Adaptation**: Solve technical challenges as they arise
4. **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporate feedback during development
5. **Testing & Iteration**: Test each component as it's built
6. **Documentation**: Document implementation decisions and changes

## 🎯 Success Case Study: Field Configuration System

### Big Claude Planning Phase
- Identified 4 configuration options (JSON, environment variables, database, hybrid)
- Recommended JSON approach for developer-friendliness
- Specified complete architecture with fallback systems
- Defined API endpoints and database structure

### Claude Code Implementation Phase
- Created visual HTML interface instead of JSON editing
- Added expand/collapse functionality for field details
- Integrated live enable/disable toggles
- Implemented real-time preview and validation
- Added professional iconography and background styling

### Results
- ✅ **Production-ready field manager** in /dev mode
- ✅ **Zero-code field configuration** for developers
- ✅ **Complete database integration** with API
- ✅ **Backwards compatibility** with existing system
- ✅ **Enhanced UX** beyond original specification

## 📊 Decision Matrix: When to Use This Workflow

| Feature Complexity | Use Big Claude Planning | Direct Implementation |
|-------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Simple UI changes** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Single component updates** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Bug fixes** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Multi-component features** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Database + UI integration** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **New system modules** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **API design** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Architecture changes** | ✅ | ❌ |
