-- COMPREHENSIVE DATABASE PURGE SCRIPT
-- =====================================================
-- 
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: THIS WILL DELETE ALL PROCESSED DATA ‚ö†Ô∏è
-- 
-- This script removes all delivery records, processing results,
-- and related data to create a clean slate for Google Cloud AI testing.
-- 
-- PRESERVES:
-- - User accounts (profiles, auth.users)
-- - Company setup (clients, client_users) 
-- - Supplier master data
-- - System configuration
--
-- DELETES:
-- - All delivery records and analysis results
-- - All temperature readings and compliance alerts
-- - All audit logs and notifications
-- - All processing artifacts
--
-- Usage: Execute in Supabase SQL Editor
-- =====================================================

-- =====================================================
-- PHASE 1: DELETE DEPENDENT DATA FIRST
-- =====================================================

-- 1. Delete violation alerts (depends on delivery_records)
DELETE FROM violation_alerts;
RAISE NOTICE 'Deleted violation_alerts: % rows', ROW_COUNT;

-- 2. Delete compliance alerts (depends on delivery_records) 
DELETE FROM compliance_alerts;
RAISE NOTICE 'Deleted compliance_alerts: % rows', ROW_COUNT;

-- 3. Delete temperature readings (depends on delivery_records)
DELETE FROM temperature_readings;
RAISE NOTICE 'Deleted temperature_readings: % rows', ROW_COUNT;

-- 4. Delete audit logs
DELETE FROM audit_logs;
RAISE NOTICE 'Deleted audit_logs: % rows', ROW_COUNT;

-- 5. Delete notifications (if exists)
DELETE FROM notifications WHERE 1=1; -- Soft delete pattern
RAISE NOTICE 'Deleted notifications: % rows', ROW_COUNT;

-- =====================================================
-- PHASE 2: DELETE MAIN DELIVERY RECORDS
-- =====================================================

-- Delete all delivery records (contains analysis and extraction_data)
DELETE FROM delivery_records;

-- =====================================================
-- PHASE 3: CLEANUP OTHER PROCESSING DATA
-- =====================================================

-- Delete any processing queue items (if table exists)
DELETE FROM processing_queue WHERE 1=1;

-- Delete any temporary processing data (if table exists)
DELETE FROM temp_processing_data WHERE 1=1;

-- =====================================================
-- PHASE 4: RESET SEQUENCES (OPTIONAL)
-- =====================================================

-- Reset auto-incrementing sequences if they exist
-- Note: UUID primary keys don't need sequence resets, but included for completeness

/*
üîÑ ROLLBACK PLAN:

If you need to restore data, you can:

1. Restore from Supabase backup:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard > Settings > Database
   - Use point-in-time recovery to before this purge

2. Re-run test data generation:
   - Execute CREATE_TEST_COMPANY.sql again
   - Use demo data generation scripts if available

3. Import production backup:
   - If you have a backup export, re-import it
   - Ensure proper data sanitization for development

‚ö†Ô∏è  Note: This purge is designed for development/testing
   environments. Never run on production without proper
   backup and approval procedures.
