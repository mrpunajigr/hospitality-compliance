# Next Session Quick Start Plan

## 🎯 **Immediate Priority: Test Direct Email**

**First thing to try when session resumes:**

1. **Direct Email Test**  
   Visit: `https://jigr.app/api/test-direct-email?email=YOUR_ACTUAL_EMAIL`
   
   **Expected Results:**
   - ✅ **Success** → Issue is in signup flow integration  
   - ❌ **Fails** → Issue is in our API route with Resend

2. **Browser Console Test**
   - Go to: `https://jigr.app/create-account` 
   - Open console (F12)
   - Run: `fetch('/api/test-direct-email', {method:'POST', headers:{'Content-Type':'application/json'}, body:JSON.stringify({testEmail:'YOUR_EMAIL'})}).then(r=>r.json()).then(console.log)`

## 📊 **Decision Tree Based on Test Results**

### **If Direct Email WORKS:**
✅ **Resend API connection is fine**  
→ Focus on signup flow integration  
→ Check if `🧪 Testing direct email as backup...` appears in signup logs  
→ Fix timing/integration issues in welcome email call  

### **If Direct Email FAILS:**
❌ **API route has issues**  
→ Focus on `/api/send-email` route debugging  
→ Check environment variable access in API routes  
→ Create minimal test email route  

## 🔧 **Ready Solutions**

### **If Integration Issue:**
- Check welcome email function timing
- Verify email function executes during signup  
- Fix race conditions with page redirects

### **If API Route Issue:**
- Create simplified direct Resend call
- Bypass complex template system
- Check API route middleware conflicts

## 📧 **Success Target**
User receives welcome email with login details after signup.

**Session Context**: Email delivery failing with CSRF errors despite verified domain and API key  
**Root Issue**: Internal API route problems, not Resend API itself  
**Next Step**: Direct email testing to isolate problem area
